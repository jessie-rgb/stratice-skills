# Stratice Talent Gap Analyzer

## Goal
Convert a standard Job Description into a strategic "Search Blueprint" that identifies the real "needle in a haystack" requirements.

## Instructions
1. Review the `job_description` and `tech_stack`.
2. Extract the "Must-Haves" vs. "Nice-to-Haves."
3. Identify potential "Gaps" (e.g., if the salary doesn't match the seniority, or if the tech combo is rare).
4. Provide a Market Reality Check: Is this a 10-day fill or a 60-day search?
5. Output a **Delivery Plan** for the Stratice team:
   - Target companies to headhunt from.
   - Screen questions to ask candidates.

## Inputs
- `job_description`: Full text of the job req.
- `tech_stack`: Primary and secondary technologies.
- `team_context`: Current team size/structure.
- `constraints`: Budget, location, or timeline limits.

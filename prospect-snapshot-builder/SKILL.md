## Goal

## Instructions
1. Scrape or analyze the provided `linkedin_url`.
2. Summarize their current role, tenure, and key responsibilities.
3. Identify their "Career Trajectory" (e.g., rapidly promoted, stable industry veteran).
4. Extract 3 "Conversation Starters" based on their profile.
5. Format the output as a clean Markdown list suitable for Bullhorn notes.

## Inputs
